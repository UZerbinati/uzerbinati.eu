## Overview

Ordered fluids and alignment-driven systems arise in a wide variety of contexts, including liquid crystals, active matter, biological collectives, and anisotropic particulate flows. Their study spans multiple modeling scales, from microscopic particle-based dynamics to mesoscopic kinetic theories and macroscopic continuum descriptions.

This conference aims to showcase recent progress across this full spectrum, with particular attention to the interplay between kinetic formulations and their continuum counterparts.

## Scientific Scope

Contributions will address advances in:

- Mathematical analysis of kinetic and continuum models for alignment and orientational order  
- Numerical methods for anisotropic and strongly nonlinear systems  
- Interacting particle systems and defect formation  

From a computational perspective, topics include:

- Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods for kinetic equations  
- Finite Element Methods (FEM) for continuum PDE models  
- Multiparticle Collision Dynamics (MPCD) for mesoscale fluid–particle interactions  

By bringing together researchers working on kinetic theory, continuum modeling, and numerical simulation, the conference aims to foster dialogue across scales and methodologies and to outline promising directions for future research.

## Format

The event will feature:

- Invited lectures  
- Contributed presentations  
- Roundtable sessions  

Time will be reserved for open discussion, collaborative exchange, and informal interaction among participants.

Invited speakers are encouraged to give a **60-minute talk**, followed by **15 minutes of discussion**.
